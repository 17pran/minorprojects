        <h3>Introduction to the Diary</h3>
        <p>Anne Frank wrote her diary as letters to "Kitty", a fictional friend. After hearing a radio broadcast encouraging people to document their wartime experiences, Anne rewrote her entries to prepare for future publication.</p>
        <p>She wrote about her personal feelings, relationships, and the fear of being discovered while in hiding. Her words show a deep desire to be heard and understood.</p>
